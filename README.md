# Comparable
Hello there!!!
In this project, I am showing how comparable functions in Java.
By implementing the Comparable interface, you are able to further 
use the compareTo method, that let's you sort your code.
In this case, I am using this interface, to sort my ArrayList of Animals
which holds Integers in it.
